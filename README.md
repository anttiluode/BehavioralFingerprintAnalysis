# Behavioral and Neural Fingerprinting System

A video about these systems and how you can develop them further to do medical science.

A dual-stream analysis platform for real-time behavioral pattern recognition and neural architecture analysis, 
designed to reveal the deep connections between movement and cognition.
Overview
This repository contains two complementary systems for understanding human behavioral and cognitive patterns:

Real-Time Behavioral Fingerprint System (index.html) - Live movement pattern analysis using computer vision
Brain Architecture Analyzer (brain_arch_analysis.py) - EEG-based neural connectivity and cognitive state analysis

# Components
Behavioral Fingerprint System

Real-time pose tracking using MediaPipe
Movement correlation analysis across body joints
Frequency spectrum analysis of movement patterns
Behavioral state classification (rhythmic, chaotic, synchronized, isolated)
Interactive visualizations with Plotly.js

# Brain Architecture Analyzer

EEG feature extraction across frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)
Functional connectivity fingerprinting
Cognitive state mapping and transition analysis
Region-specific analysis (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, central)
Latent space trajectory modeling

# Scientific Potential

Dual-Stream Correlation Analysis
The real scientific opportunity lies in simultaneous data collection from both systems:

Mind-Body Coupling: Correlate real-time EEG cognitive states with movement patterns to understand how mental
states manifest in physical behavior

State Transition Triggers: Identify whether cognitive state changes drive movement changes, or vice versa
Individual Coupling Signatures: Map person-specific relationships between neural patterns and behavioral expressions
Temporal Lag Analysis: Measure delays between neural activity and corresponding movement patterns

# Research Applications

Neuroscience Research

Motor-Cognitive Coupling: Study how cognitive load affects movement coordination
Flow State Detection: Identify neural and behavioral signatures of optimal performance states
Attention Networks: Map how attentional states manifest in micro-movements and posture

# Clinical Applications

Movement Disorders: Early detection through combined neural-behavioral pattern analysis
Cognitive Assessment: Non-invasive evaluation of cognitive function through movement patterns
Rehabilitation Monitoring: Track recovery progress through coordinated neural-motor improvements

# Human Performance

Expertise Studies: Compare neural-behavioral coupling in experts vs. novices
Stress Detection: Real-time identification of stress through coordinated physiological changes
Biofeedback Systems: Use movement patterns to influence cognitive states and vice versa

Data Integration Opportunities
Synchronized Data Collection
To enable cross-modal analysis:

Timestamp Synchronization: Both systems generate timestamped data that can be aligned
State Correlation: Compare EEG-derived cognitive states with movement-derived behavioral states
Pattern Matching: Identify recurring neural-behavioral pattern pairs
Predictive Modeling: Train models to predict cognitive states from movement and vice versa

# Proposed Research Protocol

Baseline Recording: Capture 10-15 minutes of simultaneous EEG and movement data during various activities
State Annotation: Mark periods of known cognitive states (focused, relaxed, stressed, creative)
Pattern Extraction: Use both systems to identify characteristic signatures for each state
Cross-Validation: Test whether movement patterns alone can predict EEG-measured cognitive states
Individual Profiling: Build person-specific models of their unique mind-body coupling patterns

# Output Formats

Behavioral System: JSON fingerprints with correlation matrices, frequency spectra, and joint statistics
Neural System: Latent trajectories, connectivity matrices, and state transition probabilities

Future Directions
The combination of these systems opens several research avenues:

Real-time biofeedback loops where movement influences neural training
Personalized intervention systems that detect suboptimal states and suggest corrective actions
Longitudinal studies tracking how mind-body coupling changes with age, training, or illness
Cross-cultural analysis of different movement-cognition relationships

# Contributing
This system is designed for researchers interested in:

Embodied cognition
Neural-behavioral coupling
Real-time biometric analysis
Human performance optimization
Clinical neuroscience applications

# Licence MIT

The modular design allows for easy extension and integration with other physiological monitoring systems (heart rate, eye tracking, etc.).

Note: This system is designed for research purposes. Clinical applications require appropriate validation and regulatory approval.
